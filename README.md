Welcome to the Spotify Data Pipeline to Snowflake Data Warehouse project repository! This ETL pipeline project combines the power of the Spotify API, AWS services, Snowflake data warehouse, and Power BI for efficient data processing and visualization.

## Repository Overview
The **Spotify_Data_Pipe_Snowflake** repository is a project that employs an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline. It leverages the Spotify API to extract data, orchestrates the data processing using various AWS services like Lambda, S3, and CloudWatch, loads the transformed data into Snowflake using Snowpipe, and visualizes the data in Power BI dashboards.

## Key Features
üöÄ **ETL Pipeline:** The project implements a robust ETL pipeline to seamlessly extract data from Spotify, transform it, and load it into Snowflake.

üéµ **Spotify API Integration:** Utilizing the Spotify API to gather relevant data for further processing.

‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS Integration:** Leveraging AWS Lambda, S3, and CloudWatch to orchestrate the ETL process efficiently.

‚ùÑÔ∏è **Snowflake Data Warehouse:** Loading transformed data into Snowflake using Snowpipe for data warehousing needs.

üìä **Power BI Visualization:** Visualizing the processed data in Power BI for insightful dashboards and reports.
